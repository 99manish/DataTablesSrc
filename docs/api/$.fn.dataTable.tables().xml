		It can be useful to be able to get a list of the existing DataTables on a page, particularly in situations where the table has scrolling enabled and needs to have its column widths adjusted when it is made visible. This method provides that ability.

		Please note that this is a **static** function and is accessed through the `$.fn.dataTable` object, not an API instance. It can be accessed at any time, even before any DataTables have been created on the page.
