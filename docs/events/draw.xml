		It can be useful to take an action on every draw event of the table - for example you might want to update an external control with the newly displayed data, or  with server-side processing is enabled you might want to assign events to the newly created elements. This event is available to give exactly this information.

		The `dt-event draw` event is fired whenever the table is redrawn on the page, at the same point as `dt-init drawCallback` (technically the callback fires before the event, but they occur sequentially and thus either can be used to achieve the same effect).
