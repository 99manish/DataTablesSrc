Often you might wish to initialise multiple tables with a single statement. This is trivially done by using a jQuery selector which will pick up multiple tables.

All tables are completely independent (i.e. user controlled paging on one table does not effect the others), but they do share the initialisation parameters given (for example if you specific the Spanish language file, all tables will be shown in Spanish).

The example below shows multiple tables initialised with a single line of code, through the use of the `.dataTable` selector (i.e. select all elements which have the class of `dataTable`.
