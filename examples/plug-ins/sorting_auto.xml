Although DataTables will automatically order data from a number of different data types using the built in methods, When dealing with more complex formatted data, it can be desirable to define the ordering order yourself. Using plug-in ordering functions, you have have DataTables sort data in any manner you wish.

Formatted data of a particular kind can be automatically detected and a suitable ordering plug-in assigned to it by making use of DataTables' plug-in type detection abilities. For complete information about type detection and ordering plug-ins; creating them and their requirements, please refer to the plug-in development documentation.

This example shows ordering with a comma for a decimal place, as is often used in parts of Europe with automatic type detection.

A wide variety of ready made ordering plug-ins can be found on [the DataTables plug-ins page](//datatables.net/plug-ins/sorting).
