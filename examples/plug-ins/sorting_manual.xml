Although DataTables will order a number of data types using the built in methods, When dealing with more complex formatted data, it can be desirable to define the ordering order yourself. Using plug-in ordering functions, you have have DataTables order data in any manner you wish.

This is done by using the `dt-init columns.type` parameter, in combination with a ordering plug-in. The ordering plug-in can be be of any level of complexity (natural ordering for example can be fairly complex while also very powerful), and is defined by attaching to the `$.fn.dataTable.ext.type.order` object. For more information about ordering plug-ins; creating them and their requirements, please refer to the plug-in development documentation.

This example shows ordering with a comma for a decimal place, as is often used in parts of Europe.

A wide variety of ready made ordering plug-ins can be found on [the DataTables plug-ins page](//datatables.net/plug-ins/order).
