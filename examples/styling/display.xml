The DataTables default style file has a number of features which can be enabled based on the class name of the table. These features are:

* `stripe` - Zebra striped rows
* `cell-border` - Cells with a border
* `row-border` - Rows with a border (only one of `cell-border` and `row-border` should be used for a single table.
* `order-column` - Highlight the cells in the column currently being ordering upon
* `hover` - Highlight a row when hovered over

These classes can be combined (simply assign multiple classes to the table) to build up the styling that you want for your table.

The `display` class is a short-cut for specifying the `stripe hover order-column row-border` as the class name for a table. This is shown in the example below.
