Localisation of the presentation layer is important for any software package, and I aim to make this normally arduous task as easy as possible in DataTables. To this end, a number of contributors have kindly translated the language strings used is DataTables into various different languages. If you translate DataTables into any other languages, please [get in touch](/contact) or send a [Github pull request](https://github.com/DataTables/Plugins/).


## How to use

There are two methods by which you can include internalisation options in DataTables - loading the language file through an Ajax request (`dt-init language.url`), or at initialisation time using the `dt-init language` property. The following example shows how to include the German translation as an Ajax file:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.dataTables.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#example').dataTable( {
            "language": {
                "url": "dataTables.german.lang"
            }
        } );
    } );
</script>
```

For more information on using the DataTables language options, please refer to the [internationalisation section of the manual](/manual/i18n). Additionally, a live example of a language file being used is [available in the examples section](/examples/basic_init/language) and [being loaded by Ajax](/examples/advanced_init/language_file).
