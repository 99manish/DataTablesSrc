The style of the pagination options that DataTables presents to the end-user can greatly effect the look and feel of your table, as well as, of course, the interaction behaviour. DataTables has four built in paging control types (`dt-init pagingType`), and through the pagination plug-ins below you can add additional options.


## How to use

To use a pagination plug-in you must include the pagination plug-in code from the plug-ins available below, after you load the DataTables library, but before you initialise the DataTable. When initialising the DataTable, you must also tell it to make use of this plug-in, rather than using the default, by setting the `dt-init pagingType` to the value required by the plug-in.

As an example the code below makes use of the scrolling pagination plug-in saved into a file:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.dataTables.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="dataTables.scrollingPagination.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#example').dataTable( {
            "paginationType": "scrolling"
        } );
    } );
</script>
```
