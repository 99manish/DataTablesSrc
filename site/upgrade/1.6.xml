For the most part, DataTables 1.6 is a drop in replacement for DataTables 1.5. However, there are a number of points to be aware of:

## Common upgrade issues

*   Server-side processing: The parameter "iSortDir_" has been renamed "sSortDir_" to reflect the fact that it is a string.
*   The fnPageChange plug-in that used to be on the plug-in API page, has now been removed and supplanted by an internal function of the same name, but different parameters! [fnPageChange](http://www.datatables.net/api#fnPageChange).

## Plug-in changes for developers

*   Pagination plug-ins need to be updated to take account of the fact that the fnInit function now takes three parameters. The built-in functions and the once provided on the [plug-ins page](http://www.datatables.net/plug-ins/pagination) have all been updated to account for this.
*   oSettings.fnDrawCallback has been renamed to oSettings.aoDrawCallback in order to provide a hook for internal functions to run when the draw is complete.

Other than this - it **should** be plain sailing!
